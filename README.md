# Gesture-Based-UI-Project
Final Year Gesture Based UI Project 2020

Welcome to the project repository for final year module: Gesture Based UI.

To download and play this game:

 -Open a Command Prompt and enter the following command:
 *git clone https://github.com/AndreasFahey/Gesture-Based-UI-Project*
 
 -Open unity hub and add project from where you cloned it to and open project in unity.
 
 -To play TowerDefence you need a Oculus Quest Headset and to play BloonMiniGameSpeech you need a microphone of some sort or just the     standard and ensure to have laptop/pc in developer mode.
 

We were tasked to make an application with gesture based hardware/software in which we made a Virtual Reality version of the well known existing game called Bloons Tower Defence. To make this game we used the Oculus Quest Headset which was available to us through the college. To buy this VR Headset would be very exepensive so we'd like to thank GMIT for the loan of the hardware that enabled us to complete this project. 

We developed this game in Unity version 2019.3.3f1 and had to add Android modules to the Unity Version in Unity Hub to do this project:

The Objective of the game is to shoot and pop the incoming balloons before they reach their desired waypoints. For this game we made 2 different way points. If a balloon reaches the end of the waypoint the player loses a life. The balloons come in waves and the player must keep shooting the balloons before they reach the end of the desired waypoints to survive. If you look at this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zG-Zs2J_N0 this shows how the game is played if you are only unfamiliar with the original game. We made this game in our own way in virtual reality using the oculus quest headset with custom music and sound affects.

We also created a Bloons mini game due to some hardware issues out of our control (highlighted in word docs in repo) to substitute for the planned hand gestures we wanted to implement into our game. In this game we created it so we could move a balloon around a plane using speech recognition saying "up" "down" "left" and right to move the balloon with text at the bottom of the screen telling you what the speech recogniser recognised. We wanted to show what we learned in this module in terms of gestures due to the fact we were unable to implement planned hand gestures into the tower defence game.
